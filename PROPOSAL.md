## Idea summary
We would like to make a movie and TV series discovery and search app. The functions of the app will be listed below. Firstly, the home page would be a discovery page with a list of trending movies and TV series. The details of each movie including a brief introduction, casts and the movie trailer will pop up after users click the profile of the specific movie. Secondly, there will be two separate pages for genre-based filtering of movies and TV series respectively. Then, we also plan to add a search feature that allows a user to search for a particular movie or TV series based on its title. Ideally, if time permits, we would like to add a bookmark list/ watchlist that allows users to save certain movies for future reference.
